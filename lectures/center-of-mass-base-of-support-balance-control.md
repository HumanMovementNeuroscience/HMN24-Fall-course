## Pendulum Dynamics
- Hanging pendulum dynamics 
  - perturbations damp out (passively stable)
  - intro kinetic + potential energy
  - Hanging Pendulum demo
- Inverted pendulum
  - perturbations grow (passively unstable)
  - BOS vs COM  = COM-dot-dot
  - Inverted pendulum demo

## Neural control of balance
  - Muscles are springs
  - Muscles only pull
