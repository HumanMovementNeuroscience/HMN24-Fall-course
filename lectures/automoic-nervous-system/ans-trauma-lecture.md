# Intro to Trauma (The Automic nervous system)

# CNS / PNS / (ENS?) / ANS

## Autonomic Nervous System (anatomy )
- Sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
    - Sympathetic trunk (paired ganglia)
- Parasympathetic Nervous System (PSNS)
    - Vagus nerve
        - (beware of woo - dorsal/ventral, 'vagal tone' and 'polyvagal' usually means you're in Woo Town)

- Heart rate variability 
    - Respitory sinus arrythmia, hrv during inhale/exhale
        - HR increases during inhale (SNS)
        - HR decrease during exhale (PNS)
    - neurovisceral integration model  

- Your brain on prediction
    - Main task: predict the future on the basis of noisy, out of date information
    - Perceptuomotor case - catching a ball 

    - Valence
        :D vs :( 
        - Good prediction: 
            - Desired outcome :D
            - Reinforce!
                - dopaminergic system 
        - Bad prediction:
            - Undesired outcome :(
            - Re-evaluate strategy?!!

- Neurovisceral integration theory
    - Happy healthy whatever depends on ANS' ability to appropriately swab between SNS/PSNS
    - (Mostly) relaxing when its time to relax

- When stress becomes disorder
    - 'disorder' -> 'something that's getting in the way of one's ability to live their life as desired'

- Post traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
    - typically from 'acute' trauma, one Big Bad Thing
        - (think like, a car accident)
    - pop sci book - Body Keeps the  Score
- Complex PTSD 
    - typically from long term exposure to 'unsafe environment'
    - Many Many small scale hints that things aren't safe
        - (think like child abuse, or food insecurity)
    - pop sci book - What My Bones Know by Stephanie Foo

- Disodered stress response: hypervigialence 
    - Thinking nothing is safe, can't turn off SNS, can't appropraitely R&R

- Treatments/therapies
    - Use the Upper Bits to attempt to reign in the lower bits
        - Volitional Breathing (Physiological sigh)
        - Volitional eye movements (EMDR) 
        - naming/noticing sensations/emotions (somatic whosits)

- On dogs, cats, homunculi, beetles, and boxes
